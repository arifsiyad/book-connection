New Feature Ideas::
  - Propose a meeting location
  - Propose a cheaper price for a book
  - Buyer / seller ratings
  - iPhone integration
  - Report an unresponsive user!
  - Pretty (possibly HTML) emails!
  - Ability to tag books with a given course or subject

Search::
  - I decided to break this one out into its own issue:
      We need to improve the performance of BooksController::search. When rendering each book it
      currently re-queries each book's posts for sale count. We could improve this by adding another
      counter column for the posts for sale count, and then having this column incremented or
      decremented whenever a user lists, unlists, or sells a book.

Fix::
  - Move book images to a shared directory and link in!
  - Add more error handling for the Book::find_or_initialize_by_isbn method

Eventually::
  - Provide a means for users to get a new activation email
  - See if we can remove the 404.html, 422.html, 500.html files from public
  - See if we can remove the dispatch.* files from public
  - Add a prompt to the search field in /books/ to the effect of "Enter an ISBN, book title, or
    author's name..."

Deploy::
  - Write a cron job for the 'rake ts:in' command!

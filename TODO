New Feature Ideas::
  - Propose a meeting location
  - Propose a cheaper price for a book
  - Buyer / seller ratings
  - iPhone integration
  - Report an unresponsive user!

Fix::
  - Restore the "price help" feature
  - Provide a means for users to get a new activation email
  - Try and get some photos for books with a migration script
  - Confirm that the user of "@template.truncate(@book.title, 50)" in the mailer methods actually
    works
  - Change activation link in activation email so it doesn't point to gawaine.

Otherwise::
  - See if we can remove the 404.html, 422.html, 500.html files from public
  - See if we can remove the dispatch.* files from public
  - Add a prompt to the search field in /books/ to the effect of "Enter an ISBN, book title, or
    author's name..."

Deploy::
  - Write a cron job for the 'rake ts:in' command!

New Feature Ideas::
  - Propose a meeting location
  - Propose a cheaper price for a book
  - Buyer / seller ratings
  - iPhone integration
  - Report an unresponsive user!
  - Pretty (possibly HTML) emails!

Fix::
  - Provide a means for users to get a new activation email
  - Fix 404 and 500 error pages!
  - Improve performance of BooksController::search. Currently it issues a SQL command for every book
    to count the number of posts that book has for sale. We can improve that!
  - Move book images to a shared directory and link in!

Otherwise::
  - See if we can remove the 404.html, 422.html, 500.html files from public
  - See if we can remove the dispatch.* files from public
  - Add a prompt to the search field in /books/ to the effect of "Enter an ISBN, book title, or
    author's name..."

Deploy::
  - Write a cron job for the 'rake ts:in' command!

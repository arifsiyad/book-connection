New Feature Ideas::
  - Propose a meeting location
  - Propose a cheaper price for a book
  - Buyer / seller ratings
  - iPhone integration
  - Report an unresponsive user
  - Pretty (possibly HTML) emails
  - Ability to tag books with a given course or subject

Critical::
  - Put up signposts at all the locations a user might go looking for the Book Connection:
      csx.calvin.edu/
      gawaine.csx.calvin.edu/
    and have these point to the correct book connection.
  - Allow users to send password resets to alternate email accounts (and also login with alternate
    email accounts). In short, make alternate email accounts viable!

Search::
  - I decided to break this one out into its own issue:
      We need to improve the performance of BooksController::search. When rendering each book it
      currently re-queries each book's posts for sale count. We could improve this by adding another
      counter column for the posts for sale count, and then having this column incremented or
      decremented whenever a user lists, unlists, or sells a book.

Fix::
  - Add more error handling for the Book::find_or_initialize_by_isbn method.
  - The form of the method error_message_on has changed in Rails 2.2.2...fix it.
  - Make PNGs work in IE. (Test out the site in IE 6 to see if SuperSlight fixed this)
  - Spruce up the home page!

Eventually::
  - Provide a means for users to get a new activation email.
  - Advertise!!!!!

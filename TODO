New Feature Ideas::
  - Propose a meeting location
  - Propose a cheaper price for a book
  - Buyer / seller ratings
  - iPhone integration
  - Report an unresponsive user
  - Pretty (possibly HTML) emails
  - Ability to tag books with a given course or subject

Critical::
  - Allow users to send password resets to alternate email accounts (and also login with alternate
    email accounts). In short, make alternate email accounts viable!

Soon::
  - Send out an email to all Book Connection users to inform them of the new site location.

Search::
  - I decided to break this one out into its own issue:
      We need to improve the performance of BooksController::search. When rendering each book it
      currently re-queries each book's posts for sale count. We could improve this by adding another
      counter column for the posts for sale count, and then having this column incremented or
      decremented whenever a user lists, unlists, or sells a book.

Fix::
  - Make PNGs work in IE.
  - Spruce up the home page!

Eventually::
  - Provide a means for users to get a new activation email.
  - Advertise!!!!!

Hi <%= h(@user.first_name) %>,

You're getting this email because there are some big changes underway
at the Book Connection. We've spent the past year updating the system
and rebuilding it from the ground up with the hope that we'll be able
to roll out new and exciting features over the next year.

We've moved your account and all your posted books over to the new
system automatically. However, in order to keep security on the
up-and-up, we needed to reset you password. You can login and change
it back anytime if you like. Here it is for now: <%= @user.password %>

We've also moved the location of the Book Connection. It now lives at
<http://csx.calvin.edu/books/>.

So welcome to the new Book Connection!
